# Guinea Pigs Exercise

In this Nashville Software School assignment, we were to create a simple program that dynamically adds cards to the DOM. We then had to add a method to delete them.

## Usage

Add text to te user input. When you click the "create" button, a card containing your text will be added to the DOM. By clicking the "delete" button on a card, the card will be eliminated from the DOM.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/BSGreaves/guineapigs.git
cd blog
npm install http-server -g
http-server -p 8080
```

This will show in your browser at:
`http://localhost:8080`
